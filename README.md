# :question: What is this project
This is school project to learn algorithms. Maze creator, generator and solver.

 # :question: Which language and libraries used for this project
 This project developed using python language and pygame and math libraries.

 # :question: What is required for play the game
 python must be installed to computer

 # :question: How to run the game
 Simply drag the py_maze_kou file to vs code and run the mazereal01_fitgirl.py file

 # :large_blue_diamond: About Project
 This is maze generator, creator and solver. You can generate maze with dedicated matrice, then solve it. Or create compeletly random maze and then solve it.

 # :sparkles: What i learned from this
 I developed my problem solving skills and learned sorting algorithms such as: 

 :white_check_mark: Depth First Search

 :white_check_mark: Breath First Search

 :white_check_mark: Dijkstra's Algorithm

 :white_check_mark: A-Star Algorithm
